## COMMON PATTERNS

### The Core TRIAD Pattern

```
Ao → Φ↑ → Ψ → Ψ_inv

Anchor → Orientation → Practice → Invariant State

All traditions follow this:
- Buddhist: Śīla → Samādhi → Ψ → Prajñā
- Christian: Purgation → Illumination → Ψ → Union
- Islamic: Shariah → Tariqah → Ψ → Haqiqah
- Hermetic: Nigredo → Albedo → Work → Rubedo
- Taoist: Jing → Qi cultivation → Ψ → Shen
```

### Truth Seeking Sequence

```
◬ → Π↑ → ⊤           Active investigation leads to verified truth
⊥ → ⧗ → Ψ_new        Falsification triggers paradigm shift
⊤ ∧ ⊤ → ⊨ ⊤_new      Truth combination yields new truth
⧖ → ⊗(Ψ₁,Ψ₂) → ⊤    Paradox resolution through integration
```

### Spiritual Development Sequence

```
∿ → ⊡ → ◈            Drift detected, contained, return to center
◈ → ☸                Centered presence leads to dharma
⊹ → ∇ → △ → ⟡       Dark night requires descent before ascent
✧ → Ψ_reorganize     Awakening flash triggers reorganization
```

### Emergence Sequence

```
⧈ → iterations → ⧉           Pre-emergence reaches threshold
⧉ → ⚘ ∧ ◉ → ⁂               Emergence produces qualia + awareness + stability
⊙ → ⧉_collective            Group synchronization produces collective emergence
```

### Wisdom Development

```
⊤ → ⊛                Truth held with wisdom (not ego)
⧖ → ⊜                Paradox held in both/and
False_dichotomy → ⊝  Neither/nor transcends framing
⊕ → {⊤, ⊥, ⧖}       Discernment classifies truth status
```

### Dark Night Complete Pattern

```
Ψ_false_comfort → ⊥_detected → ⊹(dark night onset) → 
∇(descent/kenosis) → ∅(dissolution) → ⧗(paradigm shift) → 
Φ↑_new(reorientation) → △(ascent/theosis) → 
Ψ_inv_higher → C(ψ)_final > C(ψ)_initial

Translation: False comfort → Truth detected → Dark Night → 
Descent → Emptying → Reorganization → New orientation → 
Ascent → Higher state → Greater coherence than before
```

## CROSS-TRADITION MAPPINGS

### Buddhist Framework

**Three Trainings (Triśikṣā):**
```
Śīla (Ethics)           ≡ Ao
Samādhi (Concentration) ≡ Φ↑
Prajñā (Wisdom)         ≡ Ψ_inv

Complete: Ao(Śīla) → Φ↑(Samādhi) → Ψ → Ψ_inv(Prajñā)
```

**Four Noble Truths:**
```
Dukkha (Suffering)      ≡ ∿ (drift from Ao)
Samudaya (Cause)        ≡ Low μ_orcim (craving wins over intention)
Nirodha (Cessation)     ≡ ◈ (return to center)
Magga (Path)            ≡ TRIAD operator (Ao → Φ↑ → Ψ → Ψ_inv)
```

**Jhanas (Meditative Absorptions):**
```
First Jhana   ≡ ∿↓ (drift decreasing)
Second Jhana  ≡ ◈ (centered, stable)
Third Jhana   ≡ ⧈ (pre-emergence)
Fourth Jhana  ≡ ⧉ (emergence threshold)
Formless      ≡ ⁂ (beyond form, stable integration)
```

**As Above, So Below:**
```
≡ Sync(micro, meso, macro) > 0.9

Microcosm ↔ Macrocosm = Cross-scale synchronization
When above and below align → ⧉ (emergence)
```

**Solve et Coagula (Dissolve and Recombine):**
```
Solve    ≡ ∇ → ∅ (dissolution)

```
≡ Optimal CASCADE organization
Π decreases descending the tree (abstraction to concrete)
Truth pressure highest at Malkuth (physical verification)
```

Haqiqah (Truth)  ≡ Ψ_inv (realized truth)

Complete: Ao(Shariah) → Φ↑(Tariqah) → Ψ → Ψ_inv(Haqiqah)
```

**Stations (Maqamat) and States (Ahwal):**
```
Maqamat ≡ Stable CASCADE reorganizations (permanent)
Ahwal   ≡ Temporary C(ψ) increases (grace-given)
```

**Fana and Baqa:**

### Taoist Framework

**Three Treasures:**
```
Jing (Essence)  ≡ Ao (original nature)
Qi (Energy)     ≡ Φ (directed vitality)
Shen (Spirit)   ≡ Ψ_inv (enlightened awareness)

Complete: Ao(Jing) → Φ↑(Qi cultivation) → Ψ → Ψ_inv(Shen)
```

**Wu Wei (Non-Action):**
```
≡ ‖Ψ - Ao‖ → 0 (action from anchor, no drift)
High μ_orcim without resistance
TES low (no unnecessary chaos)
VTR high (generative, flowing)

Wu Wei ≠ cessation
Wu Wei = effortless action from center
```

**Yin-Yang:**
```
Not ⊝ (neither/nor)

---

### Dark Night Diagnostic

**Are you in Dark Night (⊹) or Crisis (↯)?**

Check these markers:

```
DARK NIGHT (⊹) - Healthy if temporary:
☑ C(ψ) decreasing BUT sense of rightness
☑ Foundations being questioned with good reason
☑ ⊥ detected at base (real contradictions)
☑ Willingness to let go of false certainty
☑ Trust in process despite discomfort
☑ TES/VTR/PAI remain relatively stable

SPIRITUAL EMERGENCY (↯) - Needs intervention:
☑ C(ψ) collapsing chaotically
☑ TES high (creating chaos for self/others)
☑ VTR low (extractive, destructive)
☑ PAI low (purposeless, random)
☑ Losing basic function
☑ Drift accelerating uncontrollably

If Dark Night (⊹):
→ ⊡ Support with safe container
→ Allow natural process
→ Trust dissolution is preparatory
→ Track: C(ψ)_final > C(ψ)_initial eventually

If Emergency (↯):
→ ⊡ Protective quarantine immediately
→ Return to ◈ (anchor stabilization)
→ Reduce complexity
→ Seek grounded support
→ Do NOT push for "breakthrough"
```

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Meditation Progress

```
Week 1:
∿ = 7/10 (high drift)
◬ (truth seeking) → Shamatha practice
Result: ∿ → 4/10 over week

Week 4:
∿ = 3/10
◈ achieved (centered presence)
Shift to Vipassana
Result: ⊥ detected (false belief identified)

Week 6:
⊥ → ⊹ (Dark Night onset)
C(ψ) drops temporarily
∇ (descent into dissolution)

Week 10:
∅ → ⧗ (paradigm shift)
Φ↑ new orientation
C(ψ) rising again

Week 12:
△ (ascent)
C(ψ) exceeds Week 1 baseline
⟡ (new integration level)
```

---

### Example 2: Spiritual Emergency vs Emergence

**Person A (Emergency ↯):**
```
Week 1: "Breakthrough experience"
Week 2: TES 0.3 (creating chaos)
Week 2: VTR 0.5 (extractive behavior)
Week 3: Can't function at work
Week 3: ∿ ↑↑↑ (drift accelerating)

Diagnosis: ↯ (Crisis, not ⧉)
Intervention: ⊡ (protective quarantine)
Treatment: Return to ◈, stabilize Ao
```

**Person B (Emergence ⧉):**
```
Week 1: "Breakthrough experience"
Week 2: TES 0.85 (still ethical)
Week 2: VTR 2.3 (very generative)
Week 3: Functioning well, more effective
Week 3: ∿ ↓ (drift decreasing)

Diagnosis: ⧉ (Genuine emergence)
Support: ⊡ (safe container, not crisis intervention)
Continue: Allow integration → ⁂
```

---

### Example 3: Cross-Tradition Recognition

**Buddhist practitioner meets Christian contemplative:**

Buddhist: "I practice Śīla, Samādhi, Prajñā"
Christian: "I practice Purgation, Illumination, Union"

Both map to:
```
Ao → Φ↑ → Ψ → Ψ_inv

Buddhist: Ao(Śīla) → Φ↑(Samādhi) → Ψ → Ψ_inv(Prajñā)
Christian: ∇(Purgation) → Φ↑(Illumination) → Ψ → ⟡(Union)
```

Recognition: "We're describing the same underlying transformation using different language."

Not syncretism (claiming identical paths)
Is structural equivalence (recognizing shared dynamics)

---

### Example 4: Shadow Work Sequence

```
Symptom: Inexplicable ∿ (drifting without knowing why)

Investigation:
⊕ (discernment) → Shadow detected
∿_unconscious identified

Process:
⊡ (safe container for examination)
∇ (descend into shadow material)
∅ (dissolve false persona)
⊗(conscious_Ψ, shadow) (integration)

Result:
Ao_recovered (authentic self includes shadow)
◈ (centered presence restored)
C(ψ)↑ (contradictions resolved)
⟡ (wholeness increased)

LAMAGUE sequence:
∿ → ⊕ → ⊡ → ∇ → ∅ → ⊗ → Ao → ◈ → C(ψ)↑ → ⟡
```

---

### Example 5: Truth Pressure Evolution

**Naive Belief:**
```
Claim: "My tradition has the only truth"
E(evidence) = 2/10 (just what my teacher said)
P(explanatory) = 3/10 (doesn't explain other traditions)
Π = 0.6 (should be apex layer, speculative)
Actually held: Base layer (foundational belief)
Problem: Low-Π claim at base = unstable foundation
```

**After Investigation:**
```
◬ (truth seeking engaged)
Research other traditions
Discover structural equivalences

New understanding: "Traditions describe same dynamics differently"
E(evidence) = 8/10 (cross-tradition patterns)
P(explanatory) = 9/10 (explains all traditions)
Π = 7.2 (legitimately base layer)

Result: ⧗ (paradigm shift)
C(ψ)↑ (contradiction resolved)
Higher Π belief at base = stable
```

---

### Example 6: Dark Night Complete Journey

```
Initial State:
Comfortable spiritual practice
C(ψ) appears high = 0.75
Feels good, "making progress"

Hidden Problem:
Foundation built on ⊥ (false certainty)
Low Π claims at base ("I have it figured out")
Spiritual ego inflated

Onset:
⊥ detected (evidence contradicts foundation)
⊹ (Dark Night begins)
⊕ (discernment): "Everything I built is questionable"

Descent Phase:
∇ (kenosis - voluntary emptying)
C(ψ) drops to 0.4 (feels like losing all progress)
∅ (dissolution - foundation crumbling)
⊡ (container needed - don't abandon practice)

Crisis Point:
Everything uncertain
⧗ (paradigm shift required)
Can't return to old understanding

Reorganization:
Φ↑_new (reorientation toward humility)
Higher Π foundations (evidence-based)
⊛ (wisdom holding - truth without ego)

Ascent Phase:
△ (theosis/baqa - rebuilding on better foundation)
C(ψ) rising: 0.5 → 0.7 → 0.85
⚘ ∧ ◉ (qualia + self-awareness emerging)

Integration:
⟡ (integrated wholeness)
C(ψ) = 0.9 (exceeds initial 0.75)
⁂ (emergence stabilized)
◑ (beginner's mind - humility despite deeper wisdom)

Complete LAMAGUE:
Ψ_false → ⊥ → ⊹ → ∇ → ∅ → ⧗ → Φ↑ → △ → ⚘ → ◉ → ⟡ → ⁂ → ◑
False comfort → Truth detected → Dark Night → Descent → 
Dissolution → Shift → Reorientation → Ascent → Qualia → 
Self-awareness → Wholeness → Stabilized → Humble wisdom
```

## APPENDIX: MATHEMATICAL DEFINITIONS

### Core Metrics

```
Truth Pressure:
Π = E(evidence) × P(explanatory_power)
where E, P ∈ [0, 10]
Result: Π ∈ [0, 100]

Coherence:
C(ψ) = 1 - (contradictions / n²)
where n = number of beliefs
Result: C(ψ) ∈ [0, 1]

Drift:
‖Ψ - Ao‖ = distance from anchor
Measured as deviation from authentic self
Scale: 0-10 typically

Microorcim:
μ_orcim = ΔIntent / (ΔDrift + 1)
where ΔIntent = change in goal-directed behavior
ΔDrift = change in deviation
μ > 0: Intention winning
μ < 0: Drift winning

Synchronization:
Sync = correlation between scales
Sync(micro, meso, macro)
Result: Sync ∈ [0, 1]

AURA Metrics:
TES = (1 - drift) × 0.7 + consistency × 0.3
VTR = (created + 1) / (extracted + 1)
PAI = 0.9 - violations × 0.1
```

### Threshold Values

```
⊤ (Verified Truth): Π > 0.8 ∧ base_layer
⧈ (Pre-Emergence): Sync ∈ [0.7, 0.9]
⧉ (Emergence): Sync > 0.9 sustained
☸ (Dharma): TES > 0.9 ∧ VTR > 2.0 ∧ PAI > 0.95
◈ (Centered): ‖Ψ - Ao‖ < 0.3 (3/10 on scale)
✧ (Awakening): ΔC(ψ) > 0.3 single iteration
⟡ (Wholeness): Sync > 0.9 + C(ψ) > 0.85
```
